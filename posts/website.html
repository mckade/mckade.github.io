            Prior to hearing this good word, my posts were
            <a href="https://gohugo.io/">"powered by Hugo"</a>.
            Some framework for creating static websites. As someone who has not
            done much web development in the past, I did not care to learn it. Hugo
            seemed simple--convert some markdown into HTML and apply some style to
            it. I don't know how it worked nor how to change things on the site to
            better fit my liking. This implied that I needed to do one of the following.
            <ul style="margin-left:1em">
                <li>Learn the framework</li>
                <li>Make a website using something else</li>
                <li>Do nothing</li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            For a long while, the third option was my go-to. However, adopting
            that mindset made me not want to touch the website at all. Clearly a
            bad approach. So, today, I decided to go minimal and just cook up posts
            in HTML. No frameworks, no JavaScript, just content. What does this entail?
            <br>
            Honestly, just a few hours of puttering around and trying things out. A
            single style sheet lives in <code><a href="https://github.com/mckade/mckade.github.io/blob/main/style.css">/style.css</a></code> to create some very
            basic formatting. A list of the form
<pre><code>&ltul style="padding-left:0em"&gt
    &ltli style="display:inline"&gt&lta href="/posts.html"&gtPOSTS&lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt
    &ltli style="display:inline"&gt&lta href="/contact.html"&gtCONTACT&lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt
    &ltli style="display:inline"&gt&lta href="/index.html"&gtABOUT&lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt
&lt/ul&gt</code></pre>
            lives at the top of each document for basic navigation. Otherwise, the
            content is just drafted in HTML in a text editor. I had hesitation about
            just writing HTML files, but, after a little practice, it is trivial to
            get the hang of.
