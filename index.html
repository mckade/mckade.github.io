            A collection of McKade's thoughts and things. This site serves as a 
            dumping ground for my interests, projects, thoughts, tools, techniques, 
            etc. Most of my work revolves around reverse engineering, vulnerability 
            research, IoT development, and systems and network security.

            This website is not powered by a framework. It is just HTML and a style
            sheet. Do you really need more?
